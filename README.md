# what-i-learned-week-8
It's *only* been 9 weeks!

1. Front End & Back End - What a complex relationship these two areas have to execute a functional app. I feel like the front end's purpose is a little bit more clear- taking the user inputs, bringing all the working functions together, receiving the returned info from the backend and then displaying it in a palatable manner for the user. The backend serves as its own respective specialty. It focuses on performing one specific function(ex. to search, to convert, to randomize an output). It may have to rely on information that's not sourced locally, but the end purpose is to perform a specific function.
2. Midterm Breakdown importance - The exercise of being able explain the steps of the midterm problems was valuable. Frequently, I approach a problem as a whole rather than trying to break it into different partitions which may facilitate the problem solving process. I think it was interesting seeing the challenges that some folks(including myself) had in describing the steps with 'normal' talk. 
3. For of Loops- The ability to execute 'for of' loops cuts both ways. On one hand, it makes things cleaner and you don't have to continue with writing certain code which can be seen as tedious, but I've also run into some issues where I lose 'focus' or 'track' of the elements because it's not written in detail. Although you'll still have to write the loop in detail when you need to exercise more than just the values, I'm starting to see the value of staying with the detailed loop until I can really increase my general coding competence.
